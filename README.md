# SSR Editor

Starter project for DV1677 JSRamverk

## Description

This is our project for the course "JavaScript-baserade ramverk" at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.
The aim of the project is to build a fully functional SSR editor while practicing on using a JavaScript framework.

### How we got the application to run

We got the application to run by following steps:

1. Add a .env file and install the npm dotenv package in order to be able to manage environment variables.
2. Set a port on which the application is to run on, we chose port 3000.

The application was now running but we found that there were som SQLite-errors. We found that where was a bash script for resetting the database which we tried to use but i didn't work properly. This was fixed by updating the paths to the affected files and after a reset of the database the errors were solved.

## Framework

We have chosen to use React for this project. The reasoning behind this is that React is one of the most commonly used frameworks for JavaScript right now and it is in high demand on the labor market, which makes us believe that it is a valuable knowledge to get.
